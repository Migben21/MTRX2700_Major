Major Project Group A Assignment 3
Minutes of the team meeting
17 May, 2022, Online Meeting on Zoom

Present: Aditya Bhambri, Miguel Benatiro, Yingjie Mie 

Meeting Purpose: Update project progress for Aditya & Miguel's task for the LIDAR Module

Regular Items:
- Updated GitHub repository

New Items:
- Updated progress on each others' tasks
- Further modularised the LIDAR:
    1st part goes through half of the box. Can only go through 1 half of the box due to hardware 
    limitations if using PTU
    2nd is the LIDAR module which moves the sensor around. Splits angle into each individual angle?
    Each movement senses the LIDAR info at each point
    next part 

- Considered hardware components we're using so far, concerns about not using enough 
PTU components for marks. For now there's Servo Motors and the LIDAR itself
- Also considered we might be in charge of making the physical box model

- Adi (C Program)
    3x3 Grid with 5cm cubes, creates a program that sends 3 arrays with data of which cube 
    spaces are taken up. 1 Array for each layer. Sensor is actually sensing the top of the 
    middle of the cube. There will be preset distances for each point, including one for
    ground zero.
    Will send data for i.e. level x, x+1, x+2, x+3...

- Mig (Python Program)
    A program to compare each point
    However, using the 90-Degree Angle Assumption for now (Doesn't use PTU, this is a temporary fix)
    Takes in a number and compare which of the 4 preset values it is closest to
    There will be a preset value for each level (value being what the sensor gives)
    Build an array (in the case of a 3x3x3 cube, will be a total of 9)
    Compare given data to level 0, 1, 2 & 3 for each point

    Preset Values to on each level for now:
    Level 0: 0cm
    Level 1: 3cm
    Level 2: 6cm
    Level 3: 9cm
