Design Project Group Assignment 3
Minutes of the team meeting
29 April, 2022, Online Meeting

Present: Michael Mei, Miguel Bentiro, Stephen Capar, Yingjie Mie 

Apologies: Aditya is unable to make it to today's online meeting.

Meeting Purpose: To split project module tasks amongst the group members

Previous Actions:
- Introduced all members
- Brainstormed some ideas
- Established means of communication
- Created GitHub repository
- Decided on Project Premise

Regular Items:
- Updated GitHub Repository

New Items:
- Discussed how to modularise the Project
- Michael is initialisation, working on how to check how many boxes 
are needed
    - Has to read CSV file and determine how many boxes are needed
    - Return an array with item oredered from largest to smallest with
    each array referencing a certain box, also stating its range
    - Also consider other conditions (e.g. fragile items)
- Stephen is working on how to determine the most efficient way of placing
of objects
    - Will take in an order in which the objects placed are known
    - Will be outputted asn a array ordered in the method of which they'll
    be placed
    - It's then shown in a 3D Graph that displays where it's meant to be in
    the box, the object is then placed in the box. A function stops this
    process from contuining until a command is inputted, which checks
    the space and then proceeds.
- Yingjie is working on the placement algorithm of the items in the boxes
    - Uses a 2D Space to determine where to place the items
    - z-axis order doesn't matter. Choosing the area is more important
    - Should also do the boxes in the 3D Space. Also need a 3D Representation
    of where the boxes will go (Maybe using matplotlib)
- Aditya and Miguel are working on getting the LIDAR working
    - Should consider that its range is radial

- A draw.io diagram was given for the members to add all their subroutines
 & functions to

Other things to add to project: 
- Machine beeps when complete and sends message to LCD. Also notifies
the Python console
    - Double beep for errors
    - Print a code for the error (There's an ID for every error)

Things to note:
- Decided unit of measurement for length is cm
	
AOB (Any Other Business):
None.
