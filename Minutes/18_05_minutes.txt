Major Project Group A Assignment 3
Minutes of the team meeting
18 May, 2022, Mechatronics Lab

Present: Aditya Bhambri, Michael Mei, Miguel Benatiro, Stephen Capar, Yingjie Mi 

Meeting Purpose: Update & report on progress

Previous Actions:
- Discussed progress on project
- Further modularised the tasks, particularly regarding the LIDAR

Regular Items:
- Updated GitHub repository

New Items:
- Updated progress on each others' tasks
- No longer using the 90-Degree Angle assumption with a fixed LIDAR Sensor!
- LIDAR Sensor Discussion: 
    - Will start at the bottom left of the box's bottom layer. [At (0,0,0)]
    - Exact PWM Values at each point in each box
    - Generate a set of values, by comparing the angles 
    - Turns out our LIDAR was broken, received a new one from Andre

    - Step 1: Running through each point in the box (3x3 grid or; 24cm x 24cm) [Adi]
    - Step 2: Collect LIDAR Data from each point and store in array with both PWM values 
    
    3D Array, 3 Dimensions: 2 PWM's, 1 Distance
    Points 1-50 Create a loop that takes the data at each point and puts it into an array [Mig]
    Array for 50 points
    2 PWM Values (int), 1 Distance value (int) for each point

    - Step 3: Comparing/Sending array data [Mig]
    - Compare an original array to a new array
    - Check outside the range to see that those values haven't changed as well (Optional; Time dependent)

    - Step 4: Sending data to Stephen, only has to be True/False


AOB (Any Other Business):
None.

Next Meetings:
a) Any online meetings inbetween the aforementioned meetings
b) 25 May, 2-5pm, Mechatronics Lab (Group Presentation!)
