Project Progress:
- Decided on creating a state machine to sort items on a conveyor belt and then place these items into a box
	- Will use python for code
	- Will use classes for item type and dimensions and another class for box characteristics
	- Assuming that all items have been successfully identified for the sake of simplification
		- Potentially make identification module if time allows
	- Use LIDAR to check that items placed in box are in the correct position
	- Eggs to be placed on top of all other items
	- States go from Idle -> Ready -> Tetris -> Place <-> Check -> Idle
                                                          '-> Error
	- Fixed height between grappler and conveyor belt and fixed distance between LIDAR and box
	- Stepper motor for hand
