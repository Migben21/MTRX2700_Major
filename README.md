# Controlled Universally Nextgen Tactical Systems
MTRX2700 Major project; Futuristic technology for supermarkets

Project Aim: To create a state machine that organises supermarket products from a conveyor belt.

## Introduction
This is Group _'s work for the MTRX2700 Major Project.
Code as well as documentation are stored within this GitHub Repository.

# Instructions:
## Module 1:

# High Level Information about the Code:
This section is to describe the functions and how they're broken down into modules

## Module 1: Initialisation
The function reads a CSV file, and determines how many boxes are needed. It then returns an array with each item ordered from largest to smallest with each array referencing a certain box, and also stating its range.

It must also consider other conditions (e.g. fragile items such as eggs).

## Module 2: Determining placement method
This function takes in an order in which the objects placed are known. It then outputs an array ordered in the method of which the objects should be placed. 

A 3D Graph is also shown that displays where it's meant to be in the box.

The function stops this process constantly until a command is inputted, which checks the space and then proceeds in an endless loop, constantly updating after each command.

## Module 3: Placement Algorithms (name pending?)
This module uses a 2D view of the space to determine where to place items. The z-axis is irrelevant for this as choosing the area is the main focus. 

## Module 4: LIDAR Sensor
